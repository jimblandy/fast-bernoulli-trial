//! Efficient Bernoulli sampling.
//!
//! The `FastBernoulliTrial` type is an iterator that produces a series of `bool` values,
//! where you choose the probability of it producing `true`. It's designed to help select
//! events to sample when measuring a program's dynamic behavior.
//!
//! Each `bool` value produced has the same probability of being `true`, regardless of its
//! position in the sequence and the values before and after it. Producing a `false` value
//! is quick, just decrementing a counter and comparing it with zero. `FastBernoulliTrial`
//! only consults the underlying random number generator when it returns `true`, so if you
//! are sampling very common events with low probability, the overhead is quite low,
//! despite its desirable statistical properties.
//!
//! ## What is Bernoulli sampling?
//!
//! When gathering statistics about a program's behavior,
//! we may be observing events that occur very frequently
//! (*e.g.*, function calls or memory allocations)
//! and we may be gathering information that is somewhat expensive to produce
//! (*e.g.*, call stacks).
//! Sampling all the events could have a significant impact on the program's performance.
//!
//! Why not just sample every *n*'th event?
//! That technique, called "systematic sampling",
//! is simple and efficient,
//! and it's fine if we imagine a patternless stream of events.
//! But what if we're sampling allocations,
//! and the program happens to have a loop where each iteration does exactly *n* allocations?
//! You would end up sampling the same allocation every time through the loop,
//! and the entire rest of the loop would be invisible to your measurements!
//! More generally, if each iteration does *m* allocations,
//! and *m* and *n* have any common divisor at all,
//! most allocation sites will never be sampled.
//! If they're both even, say,
//! the odd-numbered allocations disappear from your results.
//!
//! Ideally,
//! we'd like each event to have some probability *P* of being sampled,
//! independent of its neighbors and of its position in the sequence.
//! This is called "Bernoulli sampling",
//! and it doesn't suffer from any of the problems mentioned above.
//!
//! One disadvantage of Bernoulli sampling is that
//! you can't be sure exactly how many samples you'll get.
//! Technically, it's possible that you might sample none of them, or all of them.
//! But if the number of events *n* is large, these aren't likely outcomes;
//! you can generally expect somewhere around
//! <i>P</i>â‹…<i>n</i>
//! events to be sampled.
//!
//! Another disadvantage of Bernoulli sampling is that
//! you have to generate a random number for every event,
//! which can be slow.
//!
//! *- significant pause -*
//!
//! **But not with this crate!**
//! `FastBernoulliTrial` lets you do true Bernoulli sampling,
//! while generating a fresh random number only when we do decide to sample an event,
//! not on every trial.
//! When it decides not to sample, a call to `<FastBernoulliTrial as Iterator>::next` is
//! nothing but decrementing a counter and comparing it to zero.
//! So the lower your sampling probability is,
//! the less overhead `FastBernoulliTrial` imposes.
//!
//! Probabilities of 0 and 1 are handled efficiently.
//! (In neither case need we ever generate a random number at all.)
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//!     # use fast_bernoulli_trial::FastBernoulliTrial;
//!     let trials = FastBernoulliTrial::new(0.01).unwrap();
//!
//!     let count = trials.take(10000).filter(|b| *b).count();
//!     println!("Of 10000 items, {} were true.", count);
//!
//! You can supply a specific random number generator to use:
//!
//!     # extern crate fast_bernoulli_trial;
//!     extern crate rand;
//!     use rand::{SeedableRng, XorShiftRng};
//!
//!     # use fast_bernoulli_trial::FastBernoulliTrial;
//!     # fn main() {
//!     let rng = XorShiftRng::from_seed([0x3b3f4150, 0x53704c15,
//!                                       0xf66c1396, 0x09b0136e]);
//!     let trials = FastBernoulliTrial::new_with_rng(0.05, rng);
//!
//!     // Since we specified the RNG and the seed, we always get the same 
//!     // sequence, so this assertion always passes.
//!     assert_eq!(trials.take(10000).filter(|b| *b).count(), 482);
//!     # }
//!
//! ## Why a whole crate for this?
//!
//! I just think geometric distributions are cool.
//! This is as much about the comments as the code.

            //   The only value for which ln returns 0 is exactly 1; the slope of ln at 1
            //   is 1, so for small Îµ such that 1 - Îµ != 1, ln(1 - Îµ) is -Îµ, never 0. The
            //   gaps near one are larger than the gaps near zero, so if 1 - Îµ wasn't 1,

            //   one in ten trillion, which is unlikely to be distinguishable from zero in

        // In other words, the likelihood of the next n calls to `trial` returning false
        // is (1-P)^n. The longer a run we require, the more the likelihood drops. Further
        // calls may return false too, but this is the probability we'll skip at least n.
        //
        // This is interesting, because we can pick a point along this line segment
        // and see which skip count's range it falls within; the point X above, for
        // example, is within the ">= 2" range, but not within the ">= 3" range, so it
        // designates a skip count of 2. So if we pick points on the line at random
        // and use the skip counts they fall under, that will be indistinguishable
        // from generating a fresh random number between 0 and 1 for each trial and
        // comparing it to P.
        //
        // So to find the skip count for a point X, we must ask: To what whole power
        // must we raise 1-P such that we include X, but the next power would exclude
        // it? This is exactly the logarithm base 1-P, or
        // `f64::floor(f64::ln(X) / f64::ln(1-P)).
        //
        // Our algorithm is then, simply: When constructed, compute an initial skip count.

        // count.
        //
        // For a call to `trial(n)`, if the skip count is greater than n, return false
        // and subtract n from the skip count. If the skip count is less than n,
        // return true and compute a new skip count. Since each trial is independent,
        // it doesn't matter by how much n overshoots the skip count; we can actually
        // compute a new skip count at *any* time without affecting the distribution.
